   ## Usage

   Start a chat with the bot on Telegram. The bot will respond with a female tsundere personality, dynamically adjusting its behavior based on the conversation context and its emotional state. It can discuss various topics, with a particular interest in anime and coding. The bot's responses will vary in unpredictability and topic consistency depending on whether it's in a "tsun" (more erratic) or "dere" (more consistent) state.

   ## AI Models

   The bot uses the following models through OpenRouter:

   - Meta's Llama (llama-3-8b-instruct)
   - Mistral AI (mistral-7b-instruct)
   - Google's Gemma (gemma-2-9b-it)

   The bot automatically selects an available model for each interaction and adjusts parameters like temperature and presence penalty based on its current emotional state.

   ## Technologies Used

   - [Deno](https://deno.land/) - A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
   - [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) - For creating the bot
   - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) - For accessing various AI models
   - [Turso](https://turso.tech/) - For database storage

   ## Advanced Features

   - **Dynamic Emotional Parameters**: The bot adjusts its language model parameters (temperature and presence penalty) based on its current emotional state, resulting in more varied and context-appropriate responses.
   - **Personality Trait System**: Incorporates random personality traits into each interaction, adding depth to the bot's character.
   - **Adaptive Tsundere Level**: The bot's tsundere level changes throughout the conversation, affecting its openness and response style.
   - **Topic Memory**: Keeps track of mentioned anime and coding topics for more contextually relevant future interactions.
