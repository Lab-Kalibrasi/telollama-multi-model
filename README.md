## Usage

Simply start a chat with the bot on Telegram. The bot will respond with a tsundere personality, gradually warming up as the conversation progresses. It can discuss topics like anime and coding, adapting its responses based on the context of the conversation. The bot can now also express anger in response to certain triggers, adding more depth to its emotional range.

- Meta's Llama (llama-3-8b-instruct)
- Mistral AI (mistral-7b-instruct)

The bot automatically selects an available model for each interaction.
